# Customer_Review_Project

##  Problem statement

Contentsquare is a french cloud-based platform that helps business understand how and why users are interacting with their app, mobile and website. Its SaaS analyses customer behaviour through billions of anonymous web, mobile and app interactions. It then provides recommendations, with the goal of helping companies increase revenue, engagement and growth.

In this project I will show you how to realiaze an analysis to determine what customers think about Alma and their service.

I made a Python script to scrape all review from Trustpilot, stock all the data in a Google Spreadsheets via API and process a word frequency analysis.

Scraping was done with BeautifulSoup library. The analysis was done using nltk/matplotlib library.
## Instructions

- Scrap website of trustpilot to get all the data necessary
- Clear the data if necessary and Export data to a GS that we will conect via our API (This data will be stocked there and everytime we run this script, we will update the GS)
- Analysis
- Conclusions
- Ideas
